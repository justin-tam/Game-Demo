# Game-Demo
Just run the Outdoors Scene.exe in Phoenix Horizons folder to play.

This is one of my scenes for a demo game I put together in a few days last month.
It is neither complete nor overly complex, but the basics are present.

The included code files are what goes into PC and NPC behavior.

Enjoy!
